CLARITY:

Minor tense errors in language, but I get the meaning. The font size and placement for the axis titles needs to be modified to not interfere with the axis labels. As I said on somebody else's review, I like the red is bad green is good color scheme, and I think the meaning is clear here (dead/not dead). I think it hurts when a visually impaired person looks at it though.

AESTHETIC:

It looks cool because its 3D, but I think you could have flattened it. Maybe if you were able to aggregate some of the datapoints?

HONESTY:

I don't think there's any evidence of dishonesty in presentation.
