CLARITY: Lot of stuff going on so it took me a second, but I got it easily. 
I think it's fine, especially with the well managed marker sizes and colors. 

I'm not sure it wouldn't be better to associate this with actual locations rather than lat/long, but it totally depends on
what your actual purpose is, so no harm done.

AESTHETIC: I like it. I think its a well presented plot. There's a random exponential on top of the y-axis, but not a big deal.

HONESTY: I don't think there's any evidence of dishonesty.
