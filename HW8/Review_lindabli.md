CLARITY: 

The plot is excellently clear and simple. It was obvious what the message is and what the general trend is. 

Improve: I know its against convention and what we learned in class, but I tend to like descriptive text

AESTHETIC: Again, clear, simple, and easy to understand. I like subdued colors, and I assume that its ok for all visual abilities.

Improve: Nitpicky, and against the inclusivity guidelines, but I tend to like the red is bad, green is good color scheme. If there's no reason to describe good/bad, this is perfect.

HONESTY: I don't think there's any evidence of dishonesty here.
